          Bachelor of Arts in Business Technology Administration: The BA program is designed for students who want 
          a basic education in the use of IT for various business purposes. The BA degree is less technical in nature than 
          the BS program and the focus of the courses is on using IT of different types to solve problems that arise in a business setting.

          Bachelor of Science in Information System: The BS program prepares students for all potential career positions in the IS field. These include: Systems Analysis and Design, Computer Networking and Health Care Informatics.
